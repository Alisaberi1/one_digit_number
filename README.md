# one_digit_number
Mahdi, who is tired of coding, no longer has the patience for numbers that have more than one digit. For this reason, it turns it into a single digit number in its own way. in such a way that it replaces the desired number with the number resulting from the sum of its digits and reaches a new number. Then it does the same with the new number and continues until it reaches a single digit number.
